    <h1>Fried Rice</h1>
    <img src="./img/friedrice.jpg" alt="" />
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Nigerian Fried Rice is a very simple yet delicious recipe. This version
      relies on a ton of fresh vegetables, Beef Liver, and a little bit of oil
      for crisping it up. The added beef liver gives the fried Rice a very nice
      rich but subtle taste, and this is why it is one of the most popular
      choices in Nigeria. Though you can also use Shrimp or any protein youâ€™d
      like. If you would love to make vegan fried rice, you can omit the Beef
      liver or Shrimps entirely!
